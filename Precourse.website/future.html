            <p style="text-align:center">I'm excited to start my journey to becoming a programmer at Galvanize. I am eager to
              learn about full stack technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The fullstack immersive program is perfect for
              me because I have always been fascinated by the web and how it works. My goal as a Galvanize student is to learn as
              much as I can about web technologies so that I can become a great programmer.<br>
              <br>
              After Galvanize, I would love to work as a web developer for a non-profit or socially conscious company/organization
              so I can use my skills to help make a better world. I would especially love to work for a company that helps protect
              and promote the environment.</p>
