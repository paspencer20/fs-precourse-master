        <p class = "me-text">San Francisco has been my home for nearly twenty years. I was born in Yokosuka,
          Japan. When I was two, my family and I moved to the Rolla, Missouri so my father could attend university. After he
          graduated, we moved to Oklahoma City. I consider Oklahoma City my hometown since I lived there
          from age seven to twenty. A couple of months after my twentieth birthday, I moved to New York City. At first I worked
          at the Strand Bookstore and shared a tiny studio apartment in the West Village. A couple of years later I was living
          in Hoboken, working at New York University and taking classes part-time. Eventually, I moved to Highland Park, New Jersey
          to attend Rutgers University where I majored in history. After graduating from Rutgers, I moved to San Francisco to
          attend law school at University of San Francisco. I graduated and passed the bar in 2000, but early on I realized I hated
          being an attorney.  So, I started working as a legal assistant/paralegal. Eventually, I ended up working for an
          environmental law firm and stayed for nearly ten years before taking some time off to figure out something different
          to do with my life.<br>
          <br>
          Earlier this year, I happened upon coding courses on Codeacademy.com and Codeschool.com. After taking a few, I was
          hooked and wanted to learn more and realized I wanted to make it a career. Galvanize is the perfect place to pursue
          my passion for programming and eventually begin a new career.</p>

            several times. We visited many cities and towns all over central Japan. On our next trip, hopefully next year, we plan to
            explore the northern regions of Japan around Hokkaido.
