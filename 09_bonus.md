## Bonus

We're glad you're excited to get started with us! We're excited too!

However, we also take your wellness (and sanity) seriously. If you're at this point, consider doing the following before taking on anymore courses through Code Academy or Code School:

1. Relax
  * Spend time with your friends and family, catch up on your shows, and overall just relax. You'll have plenty of time to be stressed; take care of yourself so that when you start the class, you're ready to go.
1. Begin (or Continue) Good Habits
  * Include some sort of exercise into your daily routine; begin making a healthy lunch for yourself. It takes a few weeks to start new habits, so start healthy ones now.

With that said, doing the following will also be super helpful:

1. [What is Code?](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)
  * An in-depth and interactive article about the internet. It's a very, very long read but give it a shot (and try scrolling around on the page and playing with the interactive elements).

1. [Anki Flashcards](http://ankisrs.net/)
  * Anki is a free, fantastic flashcard program with no bells and whistles; except it's main, coolest feature which is spaced repetition. Anki will test you on those things you don't know as well more often and remind you about what you do know at regular intervals. It's a great tool for learning anything, including memorizing concepts and commands.

1. [typing.io](https://typing.io/) & [Typing Speed Test](http://typing-speed-test.aoeu.eu/?lang=en)
  * It is *incredibly* important that you work on your typing speed. Being able to type faster means iterating faster; that means getting to the right answer, faster. typing.io tests your typing speed with code syntax while the Typing Speed Test is a more traditional typing test. Attempt to get above 40wpm on typing.io and 70wpm on Typing Speed Test.

1. [How to Use Terminal: The Basics](http://mac.appstorm.net/how-to/utilities-how-to/how-to-use-terminal-the-basics/)
  * Every developer will perform certain tasks—navigating a file system, viewing files of a directory, etc. The following guide will introduce you to the basics of interacting with a command line interface.

1. [The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)
  * Quickly navigating around the command line is crucial to developing well. Learn the command line basics by going through the first 13 chapters.

1. [shortcutFoo](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/)
  * Most of the modules require payment, but there are a few free lessons for common text editors like Atom.

1. [Lessons Learned in Software Development](http://henrikwarne.com/2015/04/16/lessons-learned-in-software-development/)
  * One developer's list of heuristics and rules of thumb for software development. Keep these in mind as you write code.
