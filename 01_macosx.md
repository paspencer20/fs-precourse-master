## Mac OS X

**Duration:** About 2 hours

At Galvanize, we teach full stack development using **Mac OS X**, the Unix-based operating systems from Apple. While other operating systems are certainly proficient at the task of full stack development, we've found that Mac OS X uniquely blends both the graphical and command line interfaces together into an integrated, easy-to-learn development environment.

In this chapter, your objective is to demonstrate competency with Mac OS X's graphical interface. Don't worry about the command line interface for now; you'll focus on gaining competency with it throughout the in-person training. To complete this objective, please follow along with the video found below and complete the self-assessment at the end of this chapter. If you're already familiar with Mac OS X, you may be able to complete the self-assessment without watching the video. Though, you may also learn a trick or two from it.

If you've ordered a laptop through us, please coordinate with your campus on the earliest date it's available for pickup. Also, you may want to re-watch this once you obtain it.

**TIP:** While this video demonstrates usage of an older version Mac OS X called Yosemite, the information is not outdated.
